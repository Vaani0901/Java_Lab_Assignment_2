Part 1: Java program to move even and odd numbers to respective arrays
Introduction
This Java program declares two arrays named even and odd. It accepts numbers from the user and moves them to respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd.

Steps to run the program

Enter 10 numbers as prompted by the program.
The program will move the even and odd numbers to respective arrays and display them.
Explanation of the code
We import the java.util.Scanner package to accept user input.
We declare two arrays named even and odd.
We declare two integer variables evenIndex and oddIndex to keep track of the indices of the even and odd arrays respectively.
We create a Scanner object named input to accept user input.
We print a message asking the user to enter 10 numbers.
We use a for loop to accept 10 numbers from the user and check if they are even or odd.
If a number is even, we add it to the even array and increment the evenIndex variable. If a number is odd, we add it to the odd array and increment the oddIndex variable.
We use another for loop to display the even and odd numbers separately.
